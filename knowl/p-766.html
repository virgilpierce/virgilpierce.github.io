<p>We actually saw this method in the first example from our first class, but did not give it a name there. The idea is, as with <em class="emphasis">Logistic Regression</em> to use the training data to estimate the probability that a given point is in a class, and then choose the class with the greater probability. The difference is that rather than fitting the logistic function to that probability, we will instead estimate the distribution of each class and then classify the points by which one is more likely via Bayes Theorem.</p>
