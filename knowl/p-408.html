<p>A major part of any work using significant computing software like Data Science, is versioning control. Projects are usually done by a team and usually run through multiple stages of development before their final production or presentation steps. This means a challenge of the work is keeping track of what changes have been made, providing a system for changes to be vetted by the team, having a way to keep track of and resolve conflicts between versions, and possibly creating different versions that evolve independently.</p>
