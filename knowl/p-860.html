<p>Networks of neurons work together in chains by receiving input in the form of stimulation increasing (or decreasing) their charge, and once they hit a critical threshold communicating stimulation to other neurons in the network. We believe that patterns of firing neurons are responsible for the decsion making processes we can observe in the brains of organisms. There is a lot we do not completely understand about how networks of neurons behave, and it is a complicated chemical and electrical process. There is even less we understand about how the particular patterns of firing neurons in a network represent or are used making decisions. The neural network model we will use here is based on some laboratory evidence of how the data collected by sensory ograns (eyeballs) are communicated to the relevant region of the brain.</p>
