<p>Because \(F(m, b)\) is a quadratic function in both \(m\) and \(b\text{,}\) we know that the derivatives \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial m}\) and \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial b}\) are linear functions. This is nice as it implies that there is a unique solution \((m_0, b_0)\) that solves for each of them to be zero. It also means that we will be able to use Linear Algebra techniques to automate solving the equations and implmenting it in a computer program. Specifically the equations we are solving are:</p>
