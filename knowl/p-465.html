<p>What is <em class="emphasis">overfitting</em>?  Overfitting is when the model we have built was based on the sample of the data we were given and was led astray from the true relationship. This leads to models that will perform well on their training data but poorly when applied to new data. For linear relationships and linear models, overfitting is not a big problem, but for nonlinear and higher dimensional relations it becomes more likely.</p>
