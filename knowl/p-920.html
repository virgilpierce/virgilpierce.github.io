<p>Today we will look at a type of unsupervised learning algorithm called <em class="emphasis">Clustering</em> however it is worth noting that there are other approaches to unsupervised learning particularly to developing visualizations for exploring data (see <em class="emphasis">STAT 202</em>) that we will not be discussing in this class. This area of machine learning is definitly one in which research is ongoing and in the next few years there will be many PhD thesis written about unsupervised learning problems.</p>
