<p>Data Science is extremely accessible. You can do the work in this class with very little background preparation. However if you are not doing the work in this class, none of what we learn will stick with you. There are also many possible things that can happen in a data science analysis and seeing all of them requires that everyone in the class is working with us.</p>
