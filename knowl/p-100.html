<p>I hesitate to tell you how much time to budget. If all goes as planned, the Team Project will take over your life in November and December <em class="emphasis">J.K. start practicing a good work-life balance now - plan some time each week you are not doing school work. That said, also it is time to start practicing good work habits - doing things early is far more valuable than doing them at the last minute. I have never been happy with my work done while rushing. I show everyone the work I did months before it was due.</em></p>
