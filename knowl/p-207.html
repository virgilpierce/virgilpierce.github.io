<li>
<p>Hypothesis testing requires us to use the data to estimate the parameters of the distribution of players' heights.</p>
<p>These are not theoretical concerns:  Note there are some classic examples of samples taken from different distributions that have the same means and standard deviations.</p>
<p>These problems become worse the larger the dimension we work with - the more features we include. This is called the curse of dimensionality:  Suppose we had n data points estimating a distribution in one dimension. The amount of data we need in order to be as certain of our estimates of a distribution for dimension d, is proportional to $ n^d $.</p>

<li>
<p>The question we answered with the T-test or Confidence Interval computation is not really very instructive.</p>
<p>Pitchers are, on the mean, taller. But that does not tell us necessarily given a players height (and weight and age) whether they are likely to be a pitcher or not. In other words, what we have is a rather blunt instrument: Given that a player is a pitcher, we have an estimate of their height. We could give an interval estimate for an individuals height and vary it to balance the Type 1 and Type 2 errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a 4th problem: We have only used 1/3 of the numerical data we had about players.</p>
<p>While generally speaking we do not just want to use all of the data just because we have it, we will discuss the downsides later, we do though want to consider whether the data we have helps clarify the question.</p>
