<p>Note that we have, or suspect we have, some samples that do not fit the same pattern as the rest of the data. An important question is to consider the impact that these samples have on the model we have computed. We do that by computing the linear regression with each point removed. Normally we would not know what points do not fit with the others (though we may have suspicions) so the best practice is to go through all of them.</p>
