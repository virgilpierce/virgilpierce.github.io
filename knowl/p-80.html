<p>As you have gathered by a now, a large portion of the coursework will be done by you and your team. We will have 11 classes specifically dedicated to you and your team working on a problem. You will probably need to find time outside of class to work either together or at least on parts of your common problem and the activities for class. Being a good team member is a skill, as much of a skill as programing, and like any skill it takes practice to do well.</p>
