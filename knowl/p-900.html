<p>In some applications, such as image recognition, interpretation is not the goal and we can easily give up interpretation in favor of models that perform better. In other applications, such as medical studies like models that are trying to predict cancer, interpretation is possibly needed because it would help inform future studies into the mechanisms and treatments of disease. On the other hand in some medical settings the goal is to build methods of automating treatment decisions and for these accuracy would be prefered over interpretation. In other applications such as studying housing data for a city, intrepretation may be the primary reason for building a model. The example I keep in mind is my work on studying student success in mathematics and science courses, while it is interesting that neural networks produce very accurate predictions of which students need additional support, they are ineffective at being used for placement of students because we cannot answer the fundamental question of <em class="emphasis">What does the student need to do to improve their placement?</em></p>
