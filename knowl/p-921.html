<p>The goal of clustering algorithms is to separate the samples into groups or clusters by the values of their features. A classic use case of this in studying the genomic variety of a species. For example in tracing the process by which an agricultural plant (such as <em class="emphasis">Cannabis Sativa</em> or <em class="emphasis">Humulus Lupulus</em>) has been domesticated one might collect the proportions of various codes included in their DNA for samples of the plants from a wide geographic region and then ask if there are identifiable subgroups within the species.</p>
