<p>Neural networks, paritcularly those with a large number of layers are very difficult to interepret. What we can do is ask what are the coefficients that were computed by the model connecting each layer. This is easy to understand for the connection between the features and the first hidden layer but becomes increasingly hard to interpret with each successive layer. This model with five layers will be especially difficult to interpret.</p>
