<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Identifying the Question.</span></h5>
<p>So to increase value using your data science expertise the first thing you need to do is identify a question <ul class="disc"><li><p>you want to find a classification or regreesion problem that if you could answer it would allow your company to do more with less.</p></li></ul></p>
<p>The University of Northern Colorado provides support to students in some early mathematics classes based upon their score on the ALEKS placement. So the question is, for a course like <em class="emphasis">Mathematics for Liberal Arts</em> that does not have support yet, can we determine from student characteristics whether a student is likely to need support or not.</p>
<p>I.e. will they complete the course with ABC or a DFW.</p>
<p>If Garmin could determine from the activities someone is doing that they are likely training for the New York City Marathon, they could begin sending them specific advertisements for products or benifits/rewards for being a Garmin customer: for example they could offer to load the course map on their device.</p>
<p>If Greeley can determine an algorithm to estimate the value of homes based upon characteristics, one of which includes the density of trees on the street or the distance from a park. The city could then use this analysis to determine where an investment in neighborhood improvements could have the greatest impact.</p>
<p>Or to analyze the negative impact of a change to zoning or ordinances.</p>
<p>There also will be situations where your company has data, but is not sure what it means or what could be done with it. At this moment that means that data has no value. If you can use an unsupervised learning method to find structure in the data, it could lead to being able to make better decisions <ul class="disc"><li><p>this means not only does the company do better, but you also have turned that data without value into something that now has value.</p></li></ul></p>
<p>For example a company might have a set of data about customers. By using clustering they might find that there are distinct groups of customers in the features, and this could lead to targeted advertising for the distinct groups.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#paragraphs-4">in-context</a></span>
