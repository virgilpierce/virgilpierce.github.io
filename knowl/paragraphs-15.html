<p>In obtaining permission from an Institutional Review Board, or permission from a company or individual owning data you wish to use, you or your company might make some promises about how that data will be used or how it will be protected. For example, in obtaining permission from Twitter to access their API you will be required to promise that you will not seek to obtain information about the political affiliation of an individual user, or that you will not publish content from Twitter without their permission. You need to honor promises that you or your employer have made regarding data and its protection. This is essential to ensuring trust in the profession, and to protecting vulnerable populations and individuals' privacy, and it is essential to protecting yourself.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-31.html#paragraphs-15">in-context</a></span>
