<li><p>Using regression to fill in missing data. If the data field that is misisng is numerical we could use one of our regression techniques to compute an estimate for the missing value.</p></li>
<li><p>Using categorization to fill in misssing data. If the data field that is missing is categorical we could use one of our categorization techniques to compute an estimate for the missing value.</p></li>
<li><p>Using "Missing" as a category. If the data field that is missing is categorical, particularly if there are many missing it, we could use "Missing" or "NaN" as a value. In some cases (like surveys) this may even provide accurate information as sometimes no response is a response. (note the example above with <em class="emphasis">Alley Missing</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Dropping the feature. An alternative to dropping samples is to drop the feature. This might be the right decision if you have plenty of other features, if it appears some other features are related to this one, and if there are many samples missing this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Separating the analysis. Finally you could run the analysis separately for samples missing this feature.</p></li>
