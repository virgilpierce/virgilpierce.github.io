<p>Much of our class time will be spent working on big and small activities with your team. Teamwork is part of Data Science, and it is also a really great way to learn. The small activities I am calling <em class="emphasis">Team Activities</em>. They are designed to be completed during class, and then your team will just clean them up a little before submiting them online to me after class. While they are team activities, you are ultimately responsible for what your team submits. There will be one a week. I would budget 3 hours per week for them.</p>
