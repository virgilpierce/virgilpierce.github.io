<p>There are restrictions on how data can be collected and used when the research is being conducted on human subjects. At federally funded institutions, proposals to do research on human subjects must be reviewed by institutional review boards. They are looking for among other things: How the privacy of subjects is being protected, how the risk of harm to subjects is being minimized, and how subjects are informed of their rights. Of particular importance is protecting vulnerable subjects (minors and prisoners for example).</p>
