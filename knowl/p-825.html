<p>Decsision Trees are especially important models in my work on Student Success as they represent the actual placement process we use at universities to determine what mathematics course students should take and what supports they need. <a class="external" href="https://www.unco.edu/nhs/mathematical-sciences/placement/results.aspx" target="_blank">Here is an example of our placement chart at UNC.</a>  You will see very quickly that this is a basic example of a decision tree. With that in mind you can see that they appear in many other places, though perhaps as models that have not been developed algorithmicly, trained on data, or tested.</p>
