<p>Going back to the website and reloading the page, you will see your file is now in the <em class="emphasis">Code</em> tab. To add the rest of your team to the project, under the <em class="emphasis">Settings</em> tab choose the <em class="emphasis">Collaborators</em> page. Enter the user names of each of your three teammates. Note this is one reason our teams are limited to 3-4 people; in order to have more collaborators on a project you need to have it be public. Note that there is an alternative process for public respositories to collaborators called <em class="emphasis">Forking</em>. This lets you work on the code for someone elses project without explicitly having their permission, you would just need their permission if you want your changes to be incorporated into the project.</p>
