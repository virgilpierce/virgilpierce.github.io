<p>Today we will talk about our first fundamentally non-linear model. These models will introduce additional degrees of freedom that result in models capable of adapting to the training data very closely. Which means then that overfitting becomes much more likely. What we will see is that there is a definite trade off between the complexity or freedom given to our model and the possibility of overfitting.</p>
