<p>The <em class="emphasis">Birch</em> algorithm builds a tree called the Characteristic Feature Tree for the data. The data is compressed into the feature tree and the algorithm stores the necessary information without keeping the entire data set used. Each node of the tree includes information about the number of samples it represents and their relatives distances and location in the feature space. There are two parameters in the algorithm a <em class="emphasis">threshhold</em> and a <em class="emphasis">branching factor</em>. One use of Birch is to reduce the size of the dataset being used as that is its primary approach in identifying samples that are closely related. It can be passed the number of clusters or it can produce as a result the number of clusters.</p>
