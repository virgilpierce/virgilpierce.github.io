<p>We have covered a number of examples where we made the decision to drop samples that had missing data. This is not always ideal, for example we may not have a large number of samples to begin with (which makes dividing the sample into testing / training sets problematic), we may have a large number of features and the sample with missing data may still have valuable information, and the sample might have unique values for some features that we need to make our model complete.</p>
