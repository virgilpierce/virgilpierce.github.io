<p>Please be aware all UNC faculty and  most staff members are “responsible employees,” which means that if you tell a faculty member about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, they must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator, Larry Loften.  Larry or a trained staff member in the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) will contact you to let you know about accommodations and support services at UNC as well as your options for pursuing a process to hold accountable the person who harmed you. You are not required to speak with OIEC staff regarding the incident; your participation in OIEC processes are entirely voluntary.</p>
