<p>Finally, I highly suggest looking through the Kaggle website. The people using Kaggle are very active in the discussion boards on most of the competitions and you can get some ideas from them. Just keep in mind that (a) not everyone is as good as they think they are, and (b) there is a tendancy I have observed for people to aim for the sophisticated methods wihtout first looking at the simple methods. Sometimes the simple methods are better, more on this during class.</p>
