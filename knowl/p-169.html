<li><p>Python is realitvely easy to learn. It is a language for which readability counts,</p></li>
<li><p>Python is highly used in Mathematics, Statistics and Science. It is generally more broadly applicable than R,</p></li>
<li><p>It is widely used in industry for Data Science and other computations,</p></li>
<li><p>Python is the recomended language for making use of cloud computing platforms (Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services), and it includes modules for Parallel Programing,</p></li>
<li><p>It is my assertion that if you learn Data Science with Python, you will easily be able to pick up R if you find yourself in a shop that uses it,</p></li>
<li><p>The bulk of my experience with Data Science has been through Python,</p></li>
<li><p>I want the class to understand what you are doing, so we need to fix the language the whole class uses.</p></li>
