<li><p>Frequently make a copy of the files and save it somewhere else on your local machine so you have a place to get back to.</p></li>
<li><p>Use development branches to try and avoid conflicts when merging with master. This means after a merge you probably want to abandon other branches unless they were modifying files that were not part of the merge.</p></li>
<li><p>Which means using separate files is a good idea too.</p></li>
<li><p>Done right Git gives you: a history of your project including developments that were abandoned and an easy way to share your work with each other.</p></li>
