<p>Hypothesis testing requires us to use the data to estimate the parameters of the distribution of players' heights.</p>
<p>These are not theoretical concerns:  Note there are some classic examples of samples taken from different distributions that have the same means and standard deviations.</p>
<p>These problems become worse the larger the dimension we work with - the more features we include. This is called the curse of dimensionality:  Suppose we had n data points estimating a distribution in one dimension. The amount of data we need in order to be as certain of our estimates of a distribution for dimension d, is proportional to $ n^d $.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-71">in-context</a></span>
