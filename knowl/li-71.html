<p>The question we answered with the T-test or Confidence Interval computation is not really very instructive.</p>
<p>Pitchers are, on the mean, taller. But that does not tell us necessarily given a players height (and weight and age) whether they are likely to be a pitcher or not. In other words, what we have is a rather blunt instrument: Given that a player is a pitcher, we have an estimate of their height. We could give an interval estimate for an individuals height and vary it to balance the Type 1 and Type 2 errors.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-14.html#li-71">in-context</a></span>
