<p>Putting aside the issue of Big Data (data that is so large that it cannot be loaded into a pandas.DataFrame all at once), the main goal in formatting the data is to set it up so that it can be represented by a pandas.DataFrame structure. Most of the examples we have seen in class have been delivered as CSV files that are ready to be read into a dataframe. The primary exceptions so far have been the Berlin Airbnb data that arrived as multiple cross referenced CSV files, and the image recognition example whose data was a collection of JPG files.</p>
