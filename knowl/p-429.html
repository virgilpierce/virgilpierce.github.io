<p><em class="emphasis">Conflicts:</em> conflicts occur when changes have been made separately from the same commit. Once git sees a conflict, commits of the conflicted files cannot be made until they have been resolved. Resolving a conflict is done either by undoing one of the commits or by using a text editor to decide which changes to keep or remove. You may have to use a command line interface (Jupyter has one) in order to fix this.</p>
