<p>There will be some homework assignments asking you to explore topics from class, and expand on some of the work we do. These are intended to be done with a partner or two <ul class="disc"><li><p>I do not suggest more than four people working together. If you have done them you will be able to actively participate in our next class. If you have not done them, you will find our next class overwhelming. There will roughly be one or two homework assignments per week, and I would budget 3 - 4 hours per week for them.</p></li></ul></p>
