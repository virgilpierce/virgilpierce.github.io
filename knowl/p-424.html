<li><p>Create an account on Github.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the <em class="emphasis">Repositories</em> tab, click the <em class="alert">New</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a name for your respository (no spaces), choose <em class="emphasis">Private</em>, and click the <em class="alert">Create Repository</em> button. Note that there are other options here. We can discuss them in class if you are interested.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <em class="alert">Set up in Desktop</em> button, it should prompt you to install the Github Desktop App if you have not already, and it should then prompt you to open the Desktop App.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Desktop App that is now open choose the directory where you want your project on your computer (note, not the directory it is currently in; I suggest keeping all of your Github projects in a Github directory), and click the <em class="alert">Clone</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>If you open that directory on your computer you will see that it is empty. Add a text file to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Go back to the Github Desktop App, and you will see that it has now noticed you made a change in this directory. Because we changed a textfile it even gives us a little preview of what we changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Right now the change is not incorporated as part of the history of the project, we make it part of the history by adding a description of what we changed and clicking the <em class="alert">Commit to master</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>The change is now part of the history of the project, but only on our local machine. We need to <em class="emphasis">Publish</em> the first branch of our project and <em class="emphasis">Push</em> the changes in it to Github so others can see them.</p></li>
<li><p>Now make another change to the file. When you go back to the Github Desktop App, it has noticed your change. Click the <em class="alert">Commit to master</em> button to make the change part of the history (or you can right click on the file and choose <em class="emphasis">Discard Changes</em> to drop them; or for a textfile you can even select which changes you want to keep and which you want to discard).</p></li>
<li><p>Then <em class="emphasis">Push</em> those changes to Github.</p></li>
