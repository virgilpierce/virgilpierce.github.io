<p>Where does a company get data. Well they need to collect it. They collect it with:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Gathering existing information from transactions (almost free),</p></li>
<li><p>Gathering additional information during a transaction (almost free),</p></li>
<li><p>Surveys (not free),</p></li>
<li><p>Observations and Experiments, Prototypes (expensive).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em class="emphasis">Preview - ethics</em>. There are ethical restrictions on what kinds of data we can collect and what we do with it. In many cases there are also legal restrictions. For example if we are collecting information that can be used to identify people, we have a duty to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>Some industries: (Education, Healthcare, and Banking for example) have many restrictions of what kinds of data can be collected and how it can be used.</p>
<p>We will take a class to talk in some detail about the ethics of Data Science.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#paragraphs-5">in-context</a></span>
