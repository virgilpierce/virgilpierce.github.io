<p>In some cases we would like to have even more runs of our model and comparisons with training and testing sets. A bootstrap of a sample is a random sampling, with replacement, of the dataset of the same size as the dataset. With replacement menas that as we construct the boostrap, we select samples to include, but then we add them back to the dataset to possibly be selected again. As the bootsrap is the same size as the dataset, this means that we expect to have some samples repeated in the bootstrap, and we also expect there to be some samples from the dataset that are missed. We then run the bootstrapping multiple times, and these two features will give us a sense of  how sensitive the model is to variations in the training data.</p>
