<p>So <em class="emphasis">Ridge Regression</em> did some of what we wanted. It produced a Linear Model that had overall smaller coefficients, and in the process that model while it did worse on the training data (which it had to, remember that <em class="emphasis">Linear Regression</em> chooses the model that will do the best out of any linear function at predicting the training data) it performed better on the testing data (though keeping in mind we really should test that statement more carefully). The model was also tuneable, we could choose an \(\alpha\) that produced a blance between training and testing \(R^2\) values (though again we are skipping the bootstrapping step).</p>
