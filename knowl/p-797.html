<p>The distance between the line and the closest training data is called the margin, and intuitively the larger the margin the better we expect the decision boundary to do on new data. Note then that the choice of decision boundary would only be affected by the points that are on the margin. I.e. if a point on the margin moves, it will cause the decision boundary to move; if a point not on the margin moves, so long as it does not move far enough to reach the margin, it will not cause the decision boundary to move. The points on the margine are called the <em class="emphasis">Support Vectors</em>.</p>
