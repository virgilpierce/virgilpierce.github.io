<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Some examples.</span></h5>
<p>Examples of (mostly) easy to download collections:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><a class="external" href="https://data.colorado.gov/" target="_blank">Colorado Data</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="external" href="https://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">USA Data</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="external" href="http://data.un.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Data</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I like these collections because much of what is here has not been completely explored. The downside is that it is not always clear what the question is.</p>
<p>It requires some digging, but some organizations, like the Pew Charitable Trust publish summaries of data analysis, and link to the data they used. This gives you a way to track down publicly available data, and also gives you some idea of how it could be used.</p>
<ul class="disc"><li><p><a class="external" href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en" target="_blank">Pew Charitable Trust</a></p></li></ul>
<p>The issue here is that organizations like Pew, by the time they have published about a data set, have probably looked into it pretty deeply.</p>
<p>However, one of the ethical considerations we will discuss is reproducibility. The conclusions and analysis published from a data set should be reproducible if others start from the same set. It takes people spending time with already analyzed data to check for reproducibility.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-27.html#paragraphs-6">in-context</a></span>
