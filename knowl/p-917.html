<p>The bulk of this course has been about data problems where we have a set of samples with some predictor features and a result. The goal has been to develop models that will use the values of the features to make a prediction about the result. However in many cases what we have is a set of samples and values for some of their features but with nothing else. This is an example of what we would call an unsupervised learning problem. The goal is to develop algorithms that will help us make sense out of datasets like this.</p>
