<p>So the best way to learn is to do, so lets start with an example. Many data sets arrive as a comma separated variable (CSV) file. This is a text file representing a spreadsheet where each entry in different columns are separated by a variable. It is worth opening a CSV file in a text editor on your computer and making sure you recognize the structure. If you have received the data as another type of spreadsheet you should open it in its native application and then save it as or export it as a CSV file.</p>
