<p>This gives <em class="emphasis">Support Vector Machines</em>, derived from this idea, an interesting property. They are typically only dependent on a subset of the training data. Which means they are less likely to be affected by errors in some of the training data or changes in the training data, and are less dependent on training data far from the other classes. In the example above this means the Irises in the upper-right coordinate of the graph in particular will not have a strong affect on where we put the division line betweent type 0 and types 1 and 2 irises.</p>
