<p>Then there is the <em class="emphasis">competitions</em> page. Kaggle runs data science competitions, in some cases with prize money. What I like about the competitions is that the datasets provided are <em class="alert">very</em> real. They will have missing data, in some cases they will be hard to obtain or use, and they will often be <em class="alert">BIG</em>. They are also organized following the principle we will explore in the Data Science process of having already been divided into a training set and a testing set. Kaggle uses the testing set to score the submissions to the competition.</p>
