<p>We will take some time to describe this result here, for those of you who have had Linear Algebra. However at the end of the day this will be one more tool from scikitlearn that we will learn to use and if necessary you can think of it as a black-box (i.e. you put your matrix of predictors into it and it spits out the most important features). If you are interested in further background, I suggest the book <em class="emphasis">Applied Linear Algebra</em> by Gilbert Strang which is now available for free on the MIT Open Courseware Website.</p>
