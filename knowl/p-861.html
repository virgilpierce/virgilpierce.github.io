<p>So our Machine Learning algorithm modeled on this is made up of <em class="emphasis">nodes</em> set up in layers that collect input that either increases or decreases their excitation level, and then communicate that excitation to the next layer that either increases or decreases excitation levels of some of the nodes in that layer (it has been found that networks using the <em class="emphasis">firing neuron</em> model are problematic to train because of their discontinuous nature so the neurons in our network will always pass their excitation level forward). The network starts with a layer that takes as its inputs values for the features we are using as predictors, and the final layer is a node or nodes that give the output (either a classification or regression). The number and sizes of the layers is a parameter set when the model is defined, and then the coefficients giving the strength of each signal passed from node-to-node are trained to fit the network to the training data using a steepest descent method to find the best choice of parameters.</p>
