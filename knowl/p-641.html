<p>You might, at this point, be a little bit unsettled. Particularly if your dataset is one with many features or has categorical features that with one-hot-encoding will become many features. How can we possibly identify all the relationships between features or identify the features that are most important in explaining our model. It is frankly, when we are thinking about a model with 81 features (before one-hot-encoding) a bit overwhelming.</p>
