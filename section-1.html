</h4>
<p id="p-18">There is a somewhat energetic debate among the Data Science community about whether the subject should be taught using Python, R, or some other language. I have made the decision to teach it using Python for the following reasons:</p>
<ul id="p-19" class="disc">
<li id="li-5"><p id="p-20">Python is widely adopted across a large portion of the sciences,</p></li>
<li id="li-6"><p id="p-21">Python is used extensively in industry for both Data Science and for other computations,</p></li>
<li id="li-7"><p id="p-22">As measured by Google Searches, Python is an order of magnitude more used than R,</p></li>
<li id="li-8"><p id="p-23">Python has an extensive collection of libraries for heavy machine learning and is the language used for interacting with cloud computing services like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and other heavy iron,</p></li>
<li id="li-9"><p id="p-24">Python is much closer to having parallel programing for Data Science ready,</p></li>
<li id="li-10"><p id="p-25">It is my assertion that after learning Data Science with Python, you will be able to quickly learn how to handle data in R (until you reach the limit of available packages).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-26">However. As I said, there is still a debate about this. I am ultimately making the decision because my training in, and use of Data Science has been more extensive with Python. In fact Python is quickly replacing Spreadsheets, Matlab, and to some extent Mathematica in my daily work.</p>
<p id="p-27"><em class="alert">While we will be using Python, no prior knowledge of Python or programing is needed for the class. We will use examples to get started in all cases. In fact the class will serve as a gentle introduction to Python and programing.</em></p>
<p id="p-28">That said, if you already know Python, you should use the class to expand your skill set. Remember the core principals of Python:</p>

</b>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

I suggest installing Jupyter and Python <a class="external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">via the Anaconda distribution at this link</a> . By the way, while on that website scroll down to the list of companies using Anaconda and Python - these are the places we are training you to work in this class.</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-5"><h4 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-30">MATH 350 or STAT 355; or STAT 150 and MATH 131</p>
<p id="p-31">While we will be using Python as part of class, CS 120 is not a prerequisite. We will have example programs to get started and will only use a small part of what Python offers as a programing language. This course in fact will serve as a nice introduction to Python programing.</p>
<p id="p-32">We will not use the scripting behavior for Python, but will do our work in the Jupyter notebooks or labs. Again, no prior experience with Jupyter is needed.</p>
<p id="p-33">Data Science is an inherently multidisciplinary field, and when looking at a project it is natural to seek or use expertise from the field the project originates with. So while not a prerequisite, expect to use and expand on your knowledge of the sciences, business, or sociology.</p></section></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-3"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.3.2</span> <span class="title">Github</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-37">There are two things we need to address in our class that we will use Github to get around.</p>
<p id="p-38"><em class="alert">Problem 1:</em> I need to get you the Jupyter notebooks and datasets we will use for class. <a class="external" href="https://github.com/virgilpierce/STAT_411" target="_blank">Both of these are in the Github repository for our class available at this link</a> . I have made it a public repository so it should be easy to find. You have two choices for using this link, you can download individual files from the repository, or you can set up your Github account and then download or clone the repository to your own computer to then open the files in Jupyter. I will accept, and be greatful for, commits back to this repository if you find typos or other things that need to be change. You can also use the "Issues" tab in the Github website to let me know about problems you have seen.</p>
<p id="p-39"><em class="alert">Problem 2:</em> You will need to be sharing files with your team and also controlling the versions you are working on. Github is used by many companies for controlling the versioning of their files, and that is how we will use it. This is a great skill to be able to talk to employers about that not everyone they interview will have. You should create a Github account. We will cover in class how your team will set up your project and the workflow you should follow.</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-8"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.3.3</span> <span class="title">Python References</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-40">You may need a Python reference book, depending on whether you prefer a book or the web for referencing. Let me know if you would like me to recomend one.</p>
<p id="p-41">That said, while I like to have a book to refer to for programing, most of the time it does not have the detail I need and I end up using in-line help or on-line help anyway. By the way, here are some examples of how you can get some inline help in Python:</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="listing-2"><pre class="console"><b># Help page describing the function or object

#   end up looking on a website.

<p id="p-42">If you would like more information about the course topics, I have found the following books useful:</p>
<ul id="p-43" class="disc"><li id="li-11"><p id="p-44">list books here</p></li></ul>
<p id="p-45">The website for scikitlearn also has a lot of information about the models we will use.</p>
<p id="p-46">Finally, I highly suggest looking through the Kaggle website. The people using Kaggle are very active in the discussion boards on most of the competitions and you can get some ideas from them. Just keep in mind that (a) not everyone is as good as they think they are, and (b) there is a tendancy I have observed for people to aim for the sophisticated methods wihtout first looking at the simple methods. Sometimes the simple methods are better, more on this during class.</p></section></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-4"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-54">A central component of the course is going to be your work with a team. We will use Slack, Canvas, Email, and Zoom for communicating outside of class.</p>
<ol id="p-55" class="decimal"><li id="li-17"><p id="p-56"><em class="alert">Zoom</em>: We will use Zoom to allow you to join my Student Hours without having to come in to my office. There is a Zoom application in the Android and Apple Application stores, or you can use it from your computer. The Zoom links for class will be shared in Slack and Canvas.</p></li></ol>
<ol id="p-57" class="decimal"><li id="li-18"><p id="p-58"><em class="alert">Canvas/Email</em>: Canvas is the Learning Management System (LMS) used by UNC. It is secure and FERPA compliant. I will be using it to post information for you individually about your grades, and also for posting any copy-protected items that I want to share with the class. If you need to discuss a grading issue or other sensitive topic with me, I would ask that you use my email address: virgil.pierce@unco.edu .</p></li></ol>
<ol id="p-59" class="decimal"><li id="li-19"><p id="p-60"><em class="alert">Slack</em>: Slack is a collaboration tool (used extensively by technology companies - Airbnb for example) and so it is very appropropriate for this class. It manages communication between teams, is more informal than email, and allows us to easily share files, photos and videos as a class.</p></li></ol>
<p id="p-61">You can join my Slack workspace with this link. Please register using your name so that I can connect what you share with you as a studnet in my class. If you have concerns about communications you have received through this platform or about sharing your name with the class, please let me know by email so we can make an arragment.</p>
<p id="p-62">The slack channel for our class is #data and we will add other channels as class goes on. You can configure your own notifications in the ways that seem the most useful to you.</p>
<p id="p-63">Why am I using Slack?</p>
<ul id="p-64" class="disc">
<li id="li-20"><p id="p-65">I receive something close to 100 email messages per day. Slack lets me keep the non-sensitive communications for my students all together in one place.</p></li>
<li id="li-21"><p id="p-66">It is more informal and provides for a more collaborative communication style than email.</p></li>
<li id="li-22"><p id="p-67">It is used by technology companies, companies this class prepares you to work for more than almost any other we offer.</p></li>
<li id="li-23"><p id="p-68">It requires fewer actions to communicate than the LMS or Email systems.</p></li>
<li id="li-24"><p id="p-69">When you ask a question in Slack everyone will see it, and then they will see the responses to it.</p></li>

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.7</span> <span class="title">Connections with Industrial Mathematics</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-71">This course is directly connected with the growing mathematics field of Data Science. There are many opportunities for people with an expertise in this field. However the field is very accessible so you have competition.</p>
<p id="p-72">Some thoughts on how to rise to the top:</p>
<ol id="p-73" class="decimal">
<li id="li-25"><p id="p-74">Have some projects you have done that you can talk about (we will do this),</p></li>
<li id="li-26"><p id="p-75">Be able to talk about working with a team i.e. how do you help your team be effective, how did you get your team over a challenge, how do you lead? (we will do this),</p></li>
<li id="li-27"><p id="p-76">Be able to talk about challenges in the field (we will do this),</p></li>
<li id="li-28"><p id="p-77">Have a breadth of experience in science or business generally, and mathematics, statistics, and computer science specifically (we will do this), and</p></li>
<li id="li-29"><p id="p-78">The more you have done the better - I suggest devoting some of your play time to working with data (we will explore Kaggle in this class, and my suggestion is that it become one of your hobbies).</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-79">I have some literature on building a career in Data Science available if you like.</p>
<p id="p-80">This Spring there will be a special section of MATH 437 that will even more check off items 1-4 here by spending the entire class looking at a problem from industry. I suggest that anyone interested in entering Data Science plan on taking it.</p>
<section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-10"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.7.1</span> <span class="title">Your Team</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-81">As you have gathered by a now, a large portion of the coursework will be done by you and your team. We will have 11 classes specifically dedicated to you and your team working on a problem. You will probably need to find time outside of class to work either together or at least on parts of your common problem and the activities for class. Being a good team member is a skill, as much of a skill as programing, and like any skill it takes practice to do well.</p>
<p id="p-82">On the <em class="emphasis">Team Days</em> you team has some formal responsbilities:</p>
<ol id="p-83" class="decimal">
<li id="li-30"><p id="p-84">You will designate someone as the leader for that day. It must rotate, and cannot always be the same person. The leaders job is to keep the team on task and make sure the goals for that day are met and the assignments for the next meeting are clear, and</p></li>
<li id="li-31"><p id="p-85">Each <em class="emphasis">Team Day</em> will end with a presentation by the team about what they have done and what they will be doing next.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-86">Some thoughts on working effectively with a team, and especially being a leader of your team: <em class="emphasis">Extreme Ownership</em> take responsibility for your team at all levels. If something about the team is not working, own it <ul id="p-87" class="disc"><li id="li-32"><p id="p-88">it is now yours to fix. If I can convince you in this class to learn one thing to take away with you, this is the one I would choose.</p></li></ul></p></section></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-8"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8</span> <span class="title">Assessments</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-89">Data Science is extremely accessible. You can do the work in this class with very little background preparation. However if you are not doing the work in this class, none of what we learn will stick with you. There are also many possible things that can happen in a data science analysis and seeing all of them requires that everyone in the class is working with us.</p>
<section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-11"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.1</span> <span class="title">Homework</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-90">There will be some homework assignments asking you to explore topics from class, and expand on some of the work we do. These are intended to be done with a partner or two <ul id="p-91" class="disc"><li id="li-33"><p id="p-92">I do not suggest more than four people working together. If you have done them you will be able to actively participate in our next class. If you have not done them, you will find our next class overwhelming. There will roughly be one or two homework assignments per week, and I would budget 3 - 4 hours per week for them.</p></li></ul></p>
<p id="p-93">They are intended to be done with others, however I understand you are busy, and ultimately if you need to do the homework alone, that will be fine.</p>
<p id="p-94">Also note that you do not necessarily need to have a perfect solution <ul id="p-95" class="disc"><li id="li-34"><p id="p-96">for one thing there rarely is a perfect solution for this class, but rather you have spent some time thinking about how to get started.</p></li></ul></p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-12"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.2</span> <span class="title">Team Activity</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-97">Much of our class time will be spent working on big and small activities with your team. Teamwork is part of Data Science, and it is also a really great way to learn. The small activities I am calling <em class="emphasis">Team Activities</em>. They are designed to be completed during class, and then your team will just clean them up a little before submiting them online to me after class. While they are team activities, you are ultimately responsible for what your team submits. There will be one a week. I would budget 3 hours per week for them.</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-13"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.3</span> <span class="title">Team Project</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-98">The major component of the class will be a data science project from your team. This will be a semester long activity with various written reports and presentations from your team. Your team will select the data and question you wish to address. Your first assignment as part of the project will be to write a short 1 <ul id="p-99" class="disc"><li id="li-35"><p id="p-100">3 page proposal of what dataset and question you wish to look at. Keep in mind that this is going to be a semester long activity. This proposal will be due after we have been introduced to various types of data and data science questions.</p></li></ul></p>
<p id="p-101">I hesitate to tell you how much time to budget. If all goes as planned, the Team Project will take over your life in November and December <em class="emphasis">J.K. start practicing a good work-life balance now - plan some time each week you are not doing school work. That said, also it is time to start practicing good work habits - doing things early is far more valuable than doing them at the last minute. I have never been happy with my work done while rushing. I show everyone the work I did months before it was due.</em></p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-14"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.4</span> <span class="title">Forming your Team</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-102">We will do this as part of class, however note that a good team should have a set of complimentary expertise. It is helpful if one member of the team has experience with Python, one with Statistics, one with Mathematics (Linear Algebra), and then some interestes in other fields from which the dataset might come. A team that is entirely programers will be missing out on the needed breadth.</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-15"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.5</span> <span class="title">Packages and Writing Algorithms</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-103">It is a common question with this class: Do we need to write code to implement this algorithm or method? The answers to this question depend:</p>
<ol id="p-104" class="decimal">
<li id="li-36"><p id="p-105">For the <em class="emphasis">Team Project</em> you may use any Python module - most of what we do will be in Scikitlearn.</p></li>
<li id="li-37"><p id="p-106">At some point during class your team will need to write a code implementing one of our mehtods. This will be one of the subassignments for the project.</p></li>
<li id="li-38"><p id="p-107">You will need to write some of your own error checking methods to evaluate methods as part of the project - particulcarly if the standard error estimate is not the best for your problem.</p></li>
<li id="li-39"><p id="p-108">The Team Activities will involve more specific algorithm implementation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-109">The difficulty for you, as a Data Scientists is:</p>
<ul id="p-110" class="disc">
<li id="li-40"><p id="p-111">All of the methods we will use are basically already coded as part of scikitlearn, unless you want to build your own Ensemble or other more involved model,</p></li>
<li id="li-41"><p id="p-112">However if you do not understand what a method is doing you will not be aware of some of the ways it can fail or lead you to false conclusions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-113">This last point can be mitigated by understanding the Data Science <em class="emphasis">Process</em> and following the procedures to get accurate estimates on the error of your model. I.e. it is not necessary to always understand exactly what a model is doing (for example, we generally do not really know why Neural Networks work other than a heuristic for why they should work) <ul id="p-114" class="disc"><li id="li-42"><p id="p-115">however if we have been true to the error estimating process we should be able to quanitfy how well the model did.</p></li></ul></p>
<p id="p-116">That said. Sometimes we will be wrong. The more critical a model is to our company, the more important it is that we control the process and account for possible errors. I.e.</p>
<ul id="p-117" class="disc">
<li id="li-43"><p id="p-118">When I'm goofing off on Kaggle learning new methods, I sequester just one subset of the data,</p></li>
<li id="li-44"><p id="p-119">If we were developing a model the city would use to determine which water lines need maitenance we would need to be sure we understand the chance of false negatives from our model and have multiple levels of sequestered data, and</p></li>
<li id="li-45"><p id="p-120">If we were developing a model the state would use to decide which inmates up for parole were likely to reoffend we would absolutely want to know the errors our model had, isolated multiple levels of data in the building process would be essential.</p></li>

<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.6</span> <span class="title">Class Presentations</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-121">You will give presentations to the class about the work we are doing. Either the team activities, your team project, or the homework.</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-17"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.8.7</span> <span class="title">Grading Policies</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-122">Your grade in the class will be based on homework, team activities, the team project, and class presentations.</p>
<p id="p-123">The weighted distribution of assessments towards your final grade will be:</p>
<ul id="p-124" class="disc">
<li id="li-46"><p id="p-125">Homework: 10%</p></li>
<li id="li-47"><p id="p-126">Team Activities: 10%</p></li>

<li id="li-49"><p id="p-128">Class Presentations: 10%</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-129">The Team Project will be assessed throughout the semester and will include the many small assignments that will eventually add up to the whole project.</p>
<p id="p-130">Final Grades will be based on a percentage of this weighted total. The distribution will be no tougher than A 90 <ul id="p-131" class="disc"><li id="li-50"><p id="p-132">100%, B 80 - 89%, C 70 - 79%, D 60 - 69%, and F 1 - 59%.</p></li></ul></p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsection-18"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
